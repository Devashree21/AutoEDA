**Here is a short FAQ about this repository**

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are discussing three interesting auto-EDA Python libraries for beginners. 
For this beginner-friendly tutorial, we will use the inbuilt ‘iris’ dataset from sklearn.

It includes the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and a readme.

**2) Which dataset has been used and where to find it?**

The inbuilt 'iris' dataset used here is from sklearn.

**3) What does the dataset contain?**

The rows in the dataset are the samples and the columns are: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

**4) Which libraries has been used for EDA?**

Three interesting auto-EDA Python libraries for beginners has been used - Pandas Profiling 3.0.0, Sweetviz 2.1.3 and AutoViz 0.0.83.

Details of the EDA and model setup are discussed in my article https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/better-eda-with-3-easy-python-libraries-for-any-beginner/ published on AnalyticsVidhya.
